# Design System: Clinic of AI

## 1. Overview & Creative North Star

### Creative North Star: "The Architectural Intellectual"
This design system bridges the gap between raw computational power and high-end editorial clarity. It moves away from the "generic SaaS" aesthetic by embracing **Organic Blueprints**—a style that feels as though a master architect is drafting the future of intelligence on premium vellum. 

To break the "template" look, we employ **Intentional Asymmetry**. Hero sections should feature overlapping elements—such as a circuit-board motif bleeding out of a container—and high-contrast typography scales that command authority. The system is grounded in a structured grid but isn't a prisoner to it; we use the grid as a visual texture to imply precision while the content floats with editorial elegance.

## 2. Colors

The palette is anchored in high-contrast sophistication, using deep, scholarly navies and charcoals punctuated by technical accents.

### Palette Roles
*   **Primary (`#001215` / `#002a2e`):** Used for deep backgrounds and high-density technical areas.
*   **Secondary (`#a14000` / `#ff7a32`):** Our "Energetic Orange." Use this for critical CTAs and highlight nodes in circuit motifs.
*   **Tertiary (`#001022`):** Deep charcoal for grounding UI elements.
*   **Surface (`#fff8f3`):** The "Off-White Vellum." This is our primary canvas, often paired with the signature grid pattern.

### The "No-Line" Rule
**Prohibit 1px solid borders for sectioning.** Boundaries must be defined through background color shifts. A `surface-container-low` section should sit against a `surface` background to create a clean, modern break without the clutter of "boxes."

### Surface Hierarchy & Nesting
Treat the UI as physical layers.
*   **Base:** `surface` (`#fff8f3`)
*   **Secondary Layer:** `surface-container-low` (`#fff2e2`)
*   **Interactive/Elevated:** `surface-container-highest` (`#efe0cd`)
Nesting these creates a natural sense of importance. An inner card should use a higher tier than its parent container to "lift" toward the user.

### The "Glass & Gradient" Rule
For floating panels or navigation headers, use **Glassmorphism**. Apply `surface` colors at 80% opacity with a `backdrop-blur(12px)`. To add "soul," use subtle gradients from `primary` to `primary_container` for hero backgrounds, mimicking the glow of a high-end monitor in a dimly lit studio.

## 3. Typography

The typography strategy relies on the tension between the "Humanity" of the Serif and the "Logic" of the Sans-Serif.

*   **Display & Headlines (Newsreader):** A strong, authoritative serif. Use this for "Clinic of AI" branding and major section headers. It conveys the "Clinic" aspect—wisdom, history, and reliability.
*   **Body & Titles (Manrope):** A clean, technical sans-serif for functional reading. It bridges the gap between editorial and interface.
*   **Labels (Space Grotesk):** Mono-spaced stylistic leanings for "technical" data points, taglines like "SYSTEMS ARCHITECTED," and UI metadata.

## 4. Elevation & Depth

### The Layering Principle
Avoid "Drop Shadows" as a default. Instead, achieve depth through **Tonal Layering**. Place a `surface-container-lowest` card on a `surface-container-low` section. The subtle shift in beige provides a sophisticated, tactile lift.

### Ambient Shadows
Where floating is necessary (e.g., a primary modal), shadows must be:
*   **Extra-diffused:** Blur radius > 24px.
*   **Low-opacity:** 4%–8% alpha.
*   **Tinted:** Use a darkened version of the background color (e.g., a navy-tinted shadow on a charcoal background) to mimic natural light.

### The "Ghost Border" Fallback
If accessibility requires a container definition, use a **Ghost Border**: the `outline-variant` token at 15% opacity. Never use 100% opaque, high-contrast lines.

## 5. Components

### Buttons
*   **Primary:** Fill `secondary` (`#a14000`), Text `on_secondary` (`#ffffff`). Shape: `md` (0.375rem). Use for "Start Building."
*   **Secondary (Technical):** Fill `primary_container`, Text `primary_fixed`. Use for "Documentation" or "Systems."
*   **Tertiary:** No fill. `label-md` (Space Grotesk) in `primary` with a hexagonal icon suffix.

### Input Fields
Avoid the "boxed" look. Use a `surface-variant` background with a bottom-only `outline` at 20% opacity. Upon focus, transition the bottom border to `on_primary_container` (Teal).

### Cards & Lists
**Forbid divider lines.** Separate list items using the Spacing Scale (e.g., `12` or `3rem` gaps) or subtle background alternates. 
*   **Clinic Special:** Incorporate a small `hexagonal brand mark` in the corner of cards to denote "Verified by Clinic of AI."

### Hexagonal Chips
For status indicators or tags, use a clipped hexagonal shape rather than a standard pill. This reinforces the "Scalable Intelligence" motif.

## 6. Do’s and Don’ts

### Do:
*   **DO** use the off-white grid pattern as a watermark on `surface` backgrounds to emphasize the "Architected" feel.
*   **DO** use the circuit-board motif as an asymmetrical accent, letting it bleed off the edge of the viewport.
*   **DO** pair the "Systems Architected" tagline with `label-md` typography in all-caps with `0.1em` letter spacing.

### Don’t:
*   **DON’T** use standard 90-degree corners for large image containers; use the `xl` (0.75rem) roundedness to soften the technical edge.
*   **DON’T** use pure black (`#000000`). Always use `primary` (`#001215`) to maintain tonal depth.
*   **DON’T** crowd the layout. If in doubt, increase spacing by two increments on the scale. High-end design requires "Oxygen."
